# Dyno Custom Commands

> Awesome Custom Commands for Dyno.

These commands were written by some pretty awesome people, which include our Main and Regluar Helpers, and our founder!

## Some of our staff include:
Founder: [@advaith1](https://github.com/advaith1)

Main Helpers: [@QuinnTDIP](https://github.com/quinntdip)

Helpers: [@amosharper](https://github.com/amosharper), [@TheRoboticon](https://github.com/TheRoboticon), [@Nex](https://github.com/NexyBoy), and [@Redstonedesiginer](https://github.com/redstonedesigner)

See our Discord server for the full list, because Quinn can't seem to ever finish this.  
> We've created a [server](https://discord.gg/D3K3Fqz) for people to test commands, chat about them, get help (with commands), and also track commands that are being worked on!
