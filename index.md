## [A message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_A-hBcH3H7SF99CdOe61TwvV7D_QyXu1PtcQuuq27Y/edit?usp=sharing)

Dear Members of the DCC Staff and Community,

I join DCC quite a while ago, back when hitting 100 members was such a massive thing. Before we had a full and complete helper team. Back when there were Testers, Helpers, Mods, Custom Command Creators, and Advaith. That was the entire team. But, sadly, as I have taken my hiatus and returned to DCC, I have noticed that much has changed. Yes, some has been for the better, but at the same time, I have noticed that some things, have been for the worse. I have watch DCC grow from a small blip on the surface of Discord, to a massive behemoth of command knowledge. I have watched members of the server grow and mature, and the server itself evolve.

The point I’m trying to show is that DCC has grown. And it has been very good in many ways, but from the perspective of someone who was here at the way begining, someone who saw what happened between Oly and Advaith, someone who’s seen the times that DCC has been brought to the brink of removal, we always managed to get around it. To move on. The problem with DCC has never been a technical problem, something easy to fix. No, after my return I noticed that it’s a social problem. Inside of the staff. Something, that I tried to fix, I had published an open letter to Advaith, outlining the basic issues that plagued DCC, and what these ment. Sadly, nothing really happened. And so with a heavy heart, I, QuinnTDIP, Quinn H, Big Brother, Main Helper at DCC, formally resign my position, and send my hope to everyone at DCC that somehow, someone, can fix the mess that it is. 

Sincerely,

QuinnTDIP#0862
Former Main Helper
